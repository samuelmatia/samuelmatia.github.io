## 🔬 Research Highlights

My recent work includes:

- **Enhancing Sentiment-driven Recommender Systems with LLM-Based Feature Engineering: A Case Study in Drug Review Analysis** – *IEEE Access (2025)*  
  [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11083619) • [Code](https://github.com/samuelmatia/llm-sentiment-drug-recsys)  
  Developed a sentiment-driven drug recommender system leveraging **instruction-tuned LLMs** for feature engineering. Introduced the **Adaptive Confidence-Weighted Scoring (ACWS)** mechanism for dynamic weighting and robust outlier handling. Conducted extensive evaluation using standard RecSys metrics and **expert clinical validation**, demonstrating improved interpretability and recommendation quality.

- **Structural Preservation in Efficient Pharmacovigilance Summarization: A Causal Graph-Based Evaluation Framework** – *IEEE AFRICON 2025*  
  Proposed a causal-graph-oriented evaluation methodology for pharmacovigilance summarization systems. Demonstrated how structural preservation metrics improve safety-critical summarization pipelines in real-world drug surveillance.

- **Large Language Models in Healthcare: Opportunities, Challenges, and Pathways Toward Trustworthy Clinical AI** – *AUTSYS-2025 (Springer LNCS)*  
  Co-authored a comprehensive study on the role of LLMs as **clinical cognitive infrastructure**, covering clinical decision support, multimodal integration, regulatory compliance, and trustworthy reasoning. Accepted for publication in the *17th International Conference on Autonomous Systems*.

- **Machine Learning in Malware Analysis** – *Book Chapter, Apple Academic Press (2026)*  
  Author of Chapter 7 in *Mastering Malware Development and Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Hybrid Malware Analysis and Virtual Sandboxing*.  
  Provides a practical and in-depth treatment of ML-based malware analysis, hybrid static/dynamic pipelines, and virtual sandboxing strategies for modern threat landscapes.
